# Credit-score-prediction

Welcome to the Credit Score Prediction project! This repository aims to provide a robust, end-to-end system for predicting an individual's credit score using advanced machine learning techniques. The project includes both backend and frontend components to deliver an intuitive experience for both developers and end users.

Project Overview
The Credit Score Prediction project is designed to predict the credit score of individuals based on their financial and personal data. The system leverages machine learning models that classify users into different credit risk categories (such as Poor, Standard, or Good), assisting banks and financial institutions in their decision-making processes regarding loans and credit approvals.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares input data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Engineering: Selects significant financial and demographic features that impact credit scores.

ML Model: Trains, validates, and deploys a classification model for credit scoring.

API Interface: Exposes RESTful endpoints for external access and integration.

Frontend UI: Provides an intuitive interface for data entry and visualization of predictions.

Modular Design: Separation of backend and frontend for flexibility and easy maintenance.

Tech Stack
Layer	Technologies
Backend	Python, Flask or FastAPI, scikit-learn
Frontend	HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SCSS
Model	Jupyter Notebook (for data science workflow)
Other	Pandas, NumPy, data visualization tools

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

pip environment

Node.js and npm (for frontend)

Git

Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/Tailor-K4MI/Credit-score-prediction.git
cd Credit-score-prediction
Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
cd backend
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the backend service:

bash
python app.py
# or
uvicorn main:app --reload  # If using FastAPI
Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
cd ../frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
npm install
Start the development server:

bash
npm start
Usage
Navigate to the frontend application (typically at http://localhost:3000).

Fill out the form with financial and demographic details such as:

Age

Occupation

Annual income

Number of bank accounts/credit cards

Interest rate, outstanding debt, payment history, etc.

Submit the form to get a predicted credit score category (Poor, Standard, or Good).

Review additional insights and explanations provided by the UI.

Model Building Process
Data Collection: Collect user financial and demographic information using forms or API ingestion.

Preprocessing: Clean data, encode categorical variables, handle outliers and missing values.

Feature Engineering: Select key features using correlation heatmaps and statistical analysis.

Model Training: Use classifiers such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or Logistic Regression to fit the data.

Evaluation: Validate model with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Deployment: Load the trained model in the backend and expose prediction endpoints for the UI.
