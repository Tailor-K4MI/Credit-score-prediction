# Credit Score Prediction

Welcome to the **Credit Score Prediction** project! This repository aims to provide a robust, end-to-end system for predicting an individual's credit score using advanced machine learning techniques. The project includes both backend and frontend components to deliver an intuitive experience for both developers and end users.

## Project Overview

The Credit Score Prediction project is designed to predict the credit score of individuals based on their financial and personal data. The system leverages machine learning models that classify users into different credit risk categories (such as *Poor*, *Standard*, or *Good*), assisting banks and financial institutions in their decision-making processes regarding loans and credit approvals.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares input data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering:** Selects significant financial and demographic features that impact credit scores.
- **ML Model:** Trains, validates, and deploys a classification model for credit scoring.
- **API Interface:** Exposes RESTful endpoints for external access and integration.
- **Frontend UI:** Provides an intuitive interface for data entry and visualization of predictions.
- **Modular Design:** Separation of backend and frontend for flexibility and easy maintenance.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip
- Node.js and npm (for frontend)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Clone the repository

````
git clone https://github.com/Tailor-K4MI/Credit-score-prediction.git
cd Credit-score-prediction
````

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
2. Install dependencies:
3. Start the backend service:



## Usage

- Open the frontend application (usually at `http://localhost:3000`).
- Enter financial and demographic details such as:
- Age
- Occupation
- Annual income
- Number of bank accounts/credit cards
- Interest rate, outstanding debt, payment history, etc.
- Submit the form to receive a predicted credit score  (350-850).
- View additional insights and explanations on the UI.

## Model Building Process

1. **Data Collection:** Gather user financial and demographic data via forms or APIs.
2. **Preprocessing:** Clean data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Select and/or create significant features that impact credit scores.
4. **Model Training:** Train classification models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or Logistic Regression.
5. **Evaluation:** Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
6. **Deployment:** Save the model and integrate it into the backend API for inference.

## Model Architecture and Methodology

### Model Architecture

- **Data Layer:** Manages data ingestion, preprocessing, and feature engineering using Pandas and NumPy.
- **Backend/Model Layer:** Handles model training, evaluation, serialization, and serving predictions via API (Flask or FastAPI).
- **Frontend Layer:** Provides a UI for users to input data and receive predictions, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Machine Learning Models Used

 `Random Forest Classifier`
  

These models effectively handle mixed numerical and categorical tabular data.

### Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Collect relevant data points — age, occupation, income, number of accounts, loan and payment history.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean data, handle missing values, encode categories, and scale numeric features (e.g., Min-Max scaling).
3. **Feature Engineering:** Use correlation matrices and feature importance to select features; derive new features (e.g., debt-to-income ratio).
4. **Model Training:** Train models on training split; tune hyperparameters with cross-validation.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Compare training and validation metrics to detect overfitting/underfitting; analyze feature importance.
6. **Model Deployment:** Serialize the best model (Pickle/Joblib) and serve it through backend API.
7. **Prediction and Interpretation:** Process user inputs from frontend, make predictions, and return categories (*Poor*, *Standard*, *Good*). Optionally provide interpretability insights.

### Model Improvement

- Periodic retraining with new data
- Continuous monitoring and updating of model and features as needed
